# QML-Test

This is a really small application that can be used as QML Playground to
implement a really simple Hacker News reader using Qt + QML.

## Recommendations
This project uses Python as its base. Python 3 is **required**.
In order to use it, you will need two main components:

- [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer), downloadable from Qt home page
- [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/), installable through `pip install PySide2`

## Facilities Included
This assumes you have no prior knowledge of PySide2 or inner Qt workings, and let you focus only on the QML aspects of the application.

**You are free to reimplement the backend portion if you wish. That's a plus.**

### Using Included Facilities
`view.qml` contains a useful exposed `backend` context property that exposes the
following properties:

- `signal listLoaded`: This signal is emitted after a list of IDs is loaded from
HackerNews API. It will be emitted after `backend.loadStories()` is called.
- `signal storyLoaded`: This signal will be emitted for each story loaded through
`backend.loadStory(id)`. It will not be emitted in case an error occurs.
- `backend.loadStories()`: Executes an async call to HackerNews API in order to
obtain a list of IDs representing the top stories. Emits `listLoaded` when it's done.
- `backend.loadStory(id)`: Takes an ID retrieved by `backend.loadStories()` and
obtains the story under that ID. Emits `storyLoaded` when it's done.

## Sample application
The following application was implemented using facilities provided by this
repository:

## Warnings
The Python backend provided by this repository is a bare-minimal representation
of a backend required to execute this application. No error handling was
implemented, and async calls will fail silently (only printing a stacktrace
generated by the thread running the function). This was intentional. Candidates
are free to reimplement the backend or improve it in case they wish.
